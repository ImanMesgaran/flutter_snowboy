# Flutter Snowboy plugin

*WARNING! This plugin is very much a work in progress. Things may not work.*

This repository contains the source code to a Flutter Snowboy package.
[Snowboy](https://github.com/seasalt-ai/snowboy) is a cross-platform
DNN-based hotword detection toolkit.

Currently only supports Android but iOS support is under way.

## Models

The Flutter Snowboy package ships with a default hotword model, "Alexa". To 
train your own model, clone [this repo](https://github.com/seasalt-ai/snowboy)
and follow the instructions.

## How to use

### Initialize

```dart
import 'package:flutter_snowboy/flutter_snowboy.dart';

...

// Instantiate
var detector = Snowboy();

// Load model and other resources.
// This is a moderately expensive operation since it involves file I/O.
var success = detector.prepare(modelPath="/absolute/path/to/model.pmdl");

// If you just want to load the default "Alexa" model:
var success = detector.prepare();
```

### Start

```dart
void hotwordHandler() {
    print("Hotword detected");
}

var started = detector.start(hotwordHandler);
```

### Stop

```dart
detector.stop();

// If you're done using it, you should clean
// up Snowboy-related resources.
detector.purge();
```

### Get state

```dart
/*
enum SnowboyStatus {
  instantiated,
  prepared,
  running,
  error
}
*/

SnowboyState s = detector.state();
if (s != SnowboyState.prepared) {
    detector.prepare();
}
detector.start();

```
